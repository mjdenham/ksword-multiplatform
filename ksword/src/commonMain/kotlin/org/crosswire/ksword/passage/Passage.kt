/**
 * A Passage is a specialized Collection of Verses. The additions are:
 *
 *  * List blurring
 *  * Range Counting and iteration (in addition to Verse counting etc)
 *  * List change notification, so you can register to update yourself, and
 * this goes hand in hand with a added thread-safe contract.
 *  * getName() to be more VerseBase like.
 *  * Human readable serialization. So we can read and write to and from OLB
 * style Passage files.
 *
 * Passage no longer extends the Collection interface to avoid J2SE 1.1/1.2
 * portability problems, and because many of the things that a Passage does rely
 * on consecutive Verses which are an alien concept to Collections. So users
 * would have to use the Passage interface anyway.
 *
 * Other arguments for and against.
 *
 *  * The generic version will postpone some type errors to runtime. Is this a
 * huge problem? Are there many syntax errors that would be lost? Probably not.
 *  * The specific version would stop enhancements like add("Gen 1:1"); (But
 * this is just syntactical sugar anyway).
 *  * The specific version allows functionality by is-a as well as has-a. But a
 * Passage is fundamentally different so this is not that much use.
 *  * At the end of the day I expect people to use getName() instead of
 * toString() and blur(), both of which are Passage things not Collection
 * things. So the general use of these classes is via a Passage interface not a
 * Collections one.
 *  * Note that the implementations of Passage could not adhere strictly to the
 * Collections interface in returning false from add(), remove() etc, to specify
 * if the Collection was changed. Given ranges and the like this can get very
 * time consuming and complex.
 *
 * The upshot of all this is that I am removing the Collections interface from
 * Passage.
 *
 * I considered giving Passages names to allow for a CLI that could use named
 * RangedPassages, however that is perhaps better left to another class.
