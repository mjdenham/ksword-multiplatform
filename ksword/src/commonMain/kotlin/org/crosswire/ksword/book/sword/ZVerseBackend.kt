/**
 * A backend to read compressed data verse based files. While the text file
 * contains data compressed with ZIP or LZSS, it cannot be uncompressed using a
 * stand alone zip utility, such as WinZip or gzip. The reason for this is that
 * the data file is a concatenation of blocks of compressed data.
 *
 *
 *
 * The blocks can either be "b" book (aka testament); "c" chapter or "v" verse
 * The choice is a matter of trade offs. The program needs to uncompress
 * a block into memory. Having it at the book level is very memory expensive.
 * Having it at the verse level is very disk expensive, but takes the least
 * amount of memory. The most common is chapter.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * In order to find the data in the text file, we need to find the block. The
 * first index (idx) is used for this. Each verse is indexed to a tuple (block
 * number, verse start, verse size). This data allows us to find the correct
 * block, and to extract the verse from the uncompressed block, but it does not
 * help us uncompress the block.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Once the block is known, then the next index (comp) gives the location of the
 * compressed block, its compressed size and its uncompressed size.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * There are 3 files for each testament, 2 (idx and comp) are indexes into the
 * third (text) which contains the data. The key into each index is the verse
 * index within that testament, which is determined by book, chapter and verse
 * of that key.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * All unsigned numbers are stored 2-complement, little endian.
 *
 *
 *
 * Then proceed as follows, at all times working on the set of files for the
 * testament in question:
 *
 *
 * The three files are laid out in the following fashion:
 *
 *  * The idx file has one entry per verse in the versification. The number
 * of verses varies by versification and testament. Each entry describes the
 * compressed block in which it is found, the start of the verse in the
 * uncompressed block and the length of the verse.
 *
 *  * Block number - 32-bit/4-bytes - the number of the entry in the comp file.
 *  * Verse start - 32 bit/4-bytes - the start of the verse in the uncompressed block in the dat file.
 *  * Verse length - 16 or 32 bit/2 or 4-bytes - the length of the verse in the uncompressed block from the dat file.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *
 *  * Given the ordinal value of the verse, seek to the ordinal * entrysize and read entrysize bytes.
 *  * Decode the entrysize bytes as Block Number, Verse start and length
 *
 *
 *  * The comp file has one entry per block.
 * Each entry describes the location of a compressed block,
 * giving its start and size in the next file.
 *
 *  * Block Start - 32-bit/4-byte - the start of the block in the dat file
 *  * Compressed Block Size - 32-bit/4-byte - the size of the compressed block in the dat file
 *  * Uncompressed Block Size - 32-bit/4-byte - the size of the block after uncompressing
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *
 *  * Given a block number, seek to block-index * 12 and read 12 bytes
 *  * Decode the 12 bytes as Block Start, Compressed Block Size and Uncompressed Block Size
 *
 *
 *  *  The dat file is compressed blocks of verses.
 * <br></br>
 * Algorithm:
 *
 *  * Given the entry from the comp file, seek to the start and read the indicated compressed block size
 *  * If the book is enciphered it, decipher it.
 *  * Uncompress the block, using the uncompressed size as an optimization.
 *  * Using the verse start, seek to that location in the uncompressed block and read the indicated verse size.
 *  * Convert the bytes to a String using the books indicated charset.
